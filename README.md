## Context

These programs were developed as of an application for a financial firm in Brazil.
Logical-mathematical problems were part of the selective process and the code in this repo is my attempt to solve some of them. 

My full (most analytical or no-code) solutions can be found [here](https://juan2cartesius.notion.site/Solu-o-dos-Problemas-4eb4f2681bc54919920d0a3a41b65b6a?pvs=4).

## Additional Comments

- A “question” (or “enunciado”) function was added just to exhibit the question to be answered
- When appropriate, automated tests were added in proper functions
- Due to the nature of the applications, consistency tests were dismissed
